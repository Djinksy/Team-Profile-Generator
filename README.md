# Installation 

To install the repository, please use the following command:

This app requires two packages to be installed:

Inquirer package `npm install --save inquirer`

Jest package `npm i jest`

In the command line of index.js run : `node index.js`

Helpful info that saved me time with inquirer: Inquirer v9 and higher are native esm modules, this mean you cannot use the commonjs syntax require('inquirer') anymore.
